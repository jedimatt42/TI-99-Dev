# TI-99-Dev

## Extended Basic

### Formula-TI

The file formula-ti/FORMULATI is a TI-99/4a Extended Basic program file. This is a recreation of the first software I wrote back in 1984.

The first video game I remember seeing on what I think was an Atari 5200 in 1982 was a side scrolling racing game. This game was
inspired by that, although they share little in the way of form.

I have tried to keep it true to the original game I wrote in 1984. There was no scoring, I was not a competative kid. It was written 
originally on a bare TI with a cassette recorder, and a black and white TV. I have added color. There was no sound then either. 

It is my intention now, to port this to fbForth, and make it more like an arcade game. Improve AI, allow speed control, add sounds...
